         <h2>Résumé</h2>
         <p>I started working since sophmore year of highschool with my dad at a company called P.I(Professional Installers). His line of work is a very physical one and I was a pretty skinny kid at that time. I would work over the summer and would go when they have room for me at the job. The job was to unload furniture to big corporations, stage them to there designated areas, and build cubicals/private offices. I mostly follow my dad around and did whatever he told me to do or whoever was in charge. The job starts at 6am and I would be done around 2pm most of the time. There would be some instances where we would have to stay later and the drive back home I would be passed out in the car. I was the youngest guy there and most of the guys there where either in their 40's or 50's, so I didn't really talk a lot during work and just sticked by my father. I worked there all the way to my senior year and after I graduated I went to a community college. I did not work for the 2 years I was at college and would save some of the money that I received from the college. After I received my bachelor's degree I was undecided on where to make my next step. A freind of mine would help get me a job at petsmart and now I have been working part time there for a year now. I am a cashier and a stocker there and have been a person they rely on a lot.</p>
         <p>I am not sure where I want to go as a coder, but I am glad that I am learning a lot and able to understand what I am doing. I'm hoping to improve more and be able to what I do with less help. I understand I'm going to need help in the future, but I want to be able to struggle less than I am now.</p>

         <p>Not to long ago last month I went on a trip to Guatemala to go visit my grandfather for the first time in my life. I never went out the country before so this was a first experience for me and I was nervous. Unfortuantely I was never able to really learn spanish when I was a kid so I only spoke english. I could only understand a certain amount and could speak few words. In the town where my dad family lives they speak a native language as well as spanish. My grandfather mostly spoke that native language so when I met him my dad or his sister had to translate for me. One of my cousins would drive my family and I around the town where my dad grew up. It was a sight to see and a very different environment that I was use to. I went to different towns and saw a lot I was not use to seeing. I saw the struggle that people and some of my family have to go through. Some live in a way  harsher environment that I live and they make do with what they have.    </p>

         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I would say one of my biggest hobbies would have to be playing video games and mostly fighting games. I was never the best at fighting games before, but the more I played different types I started to learn universal stuff for all of them. I gradually started to see some patterns and I started to get better at doing combos and how the game actually works. I'm also into anime and one of my favorite anime is Dragon Ball. A game called Dragon Ball Fighterz came out and was the first fighting game that I took very serious and learned a lot from. </p>
         <p>I'm not sure I would say I have any passions, but I really do enjoy arts and music. My dad is pretty good at drawing and would draw a varity of different objects. I did some drawings when I was little and was alright at, but I didn't have a passion for it so I just stop. I know if I take my time learning it I could be some what decent at. I like listening to different types of music and hearing different types of sounds. I know I don't have an imagination or creativity to make anything, so I'm just going to enjoy new music that's released. </p>
